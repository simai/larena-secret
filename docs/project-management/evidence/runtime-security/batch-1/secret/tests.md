Date: 2026-06-03

## Commands

```bash
PATH=/Applications/ServBay/package/php/8.2/8.2.29/bin:$PATH /Applications/ServBay/bin/composer validate --strict
PATH=/Applications/ServBay/package/php/8.2/8.2.29/bin:$PATH /Applications/ServBay/bin/composer run validate:larena
PATH=/Applications/ServBay/package/php/8.2/8.2.29/bin:$PATH /Applications/ServBay/bin/composer run test
PATH=/Applications/ServBay/package/php/8.2/8.2.29/bin:$PATH /Applications/ServBay/bin/composer run lint
PATH=/Applications/ServBay/package/php/8.2/8.2.29/bin:$PATH /Applications/ServBay/bin/composer run analyse
PATH=/Applications/ServBay/package/php/8.2/8.2.29/bin:$PATH /Applications/ServBay/bin/composer run evidence:check
```

## Result

Composer validation, Larena package validation, contract tests, lint, analyse and evidence check pass with ServBay PHP 8.2.29.

## Environment Limitation

The package `composer.json` declares PHP `^8.3`. This machine currently has usable ServBay PHP 8.2.29 and a broken Homebrew PHP binary. Therefore PHP 8.3 runtime compatibility is not fully proven in this batch and must be rechecked before release readiness.
