# Secret Package Local Scope Check Evidence

Date: 2026-06-03

Status: `implemented_pending_review`

## Scope

This batch installs package-local scope checking for `larena/secret`.

It does not change package runtime contracts, persistence, admin UI, routes, migrations or package behavior.

## Launch Record

`specs/implementation-planning/launch-records/secret-package-local-scope-check.json`

## Result

- Added `tools/larena-scope-check.php`.
- Added Composer scripts `scope:check` and `quality:gate`.
- Updated `.larena/launch-context.json` to the current package-local scope-check launch context.
- Updated `evidence:check` to include this batch evidence.

## Release Condition

This evidence remains package-local. It does not apply any canonical graph change.
